# Bookstore Ecommerce Login Page

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of a modern login page for a bookstore ecommerce platform.  
It features animated gradient backgrounds, a clean card-style login form, and responsive design using only HTML and CSS.

## Structure

- **index.html**  
  The main HTML file.  
  Contains the animated background, logo, login form, and a link to sign in.

- **style.css**  
  Handles all layout, colors, gradients, and animations.  
  Uses multiple absolutely-positioned divs with gradients and keyframe animations to create a dynamic background.

## Features

- **Animated Gradient Backgrounds:**  
  Multiple layered divs with CSS gradients and keyframe animations for a lively, modern look.

- **Centered Login Card:**  
  The login form is placed in a white card with rounded corners and subtle shadow, centered on the page.

- **Responsive Layout:**  
  Uses flexbox for centering and layout, ensuring the page looks good on different screen sizes.

- **Custom Font:**  
  Uses the Geist font from Google Fonts for a clean, professional appearance.

- **Form Handling:**  
  The form uses JavaScript to prevent page reload on submit, so animations do not reset.

## How It Was Built

- **HTML:**  
  Semantic structure with main, section, and divs for layout and content.

- **CSS:**  
  Flexbox for centering, absolute positioning for backgrounds, gradients for color, and keyframes for animation.
  All styles are in a single CSS file for simplicity.

- **JavaScript:**  
  A single script prevents the default form submission to keep the page and animations smooth.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter your email and password in the form.
3. Click "Login" (functionality can be extended in JS).
4. Enjoy the animated background and modern design.

## Customization

- You can change the logo image in the `#logo` div.
- Adjust colors and gradients in `style.css` for your brand.
- Extend the form functionality by adding your own JavaScript logic.
