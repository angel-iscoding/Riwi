# User Registration Age Verification

This is a simple practice project for JavaScript. The main goal is to verify if a user is at least 18 years old based on their date of birth before allowing them to register.

## Features

- **Date of Birth Verification:**  
  When the user enters their date of birth and clicks the "Register" button, the app checks if the user is 18 years old or older.
- **Visual Feedback:**  
  - If the user is 18 or older, a green message appears: `Signing up...`
  - If the user is under 18, a red message appears: `You must be at least 18`
- **Form Fields:**  
  The email and password fields are only for demonstration and are not validated or used.

## How it works

1. The user fills in the form and selects their date of birth.
2. When the "Register" button is clicked, JavaScript checks if the entered date is at least 18 years before today.
3. A message is displayed below the button indicating whether the user can register.

## Files

- `index.html` — The main HTML file with the registration form.
- `style.css` — Styles for the form and page layout.
- `script.js` — JavaScript logic for age verification.
- `README.md` — Project description and instructions.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Enter a date of birth and click "Register" to see the verification in action.
